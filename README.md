# Glowora-Marketing-Dashboard-CaseStudy
Power BI case study: Unified Marketing Performance Dashboard for a D2C Brand (Glowora)
🏷️ About the Brand – Glowora (Demo Project)
Glowora is a modern Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) skincare brand focused on the digital-first audience. Operating across multiple paid and owned channels, the brand heavily invests in Meta Ads, Google Ads, and Email Marketing to drive awareness, engagement, and conversions.

Note: Glowora is a simulated brand created for demonstration purposes. All data is synthetic and not linked to a real business. This case study showcases our approach and solution delivery model.

🟥 The Challenge
As Glowora scaled its marketing efforts, they faced:

✅ Fragmented Data across Meta Ads Manager, Google Ads, and Email tools
✅ Delayed Decision-Making due to manual reporting cycles
✅ Lack of Strategic Insights on ROI, ROAS, CAC, Conversion Rates

🟩 The Solution: Unified Marketing Performance Dashboard
VM Software Solutions developed a centralized Power BI Dashboard to consolidate Glowora’s marketing performance data into a single, interactive platform.
